AntHill.

Ants exhibit complex behaviour, including constructing some of nature's finest palaces, without any direct oversight, direction or individual intelligence. They achieve all of this through hive behaviour controlled by only a few signals. This project aims to replicate this behaviour for a hive of ant-like entities.

ToDo List:
1. Allow ant pheremones to be deposited onto pheremone MapArray
2. Compose multiple MapArrays into one array to be used as a potential in MMC algorithm
3. Enable ants to withdraw/deposit food. -> Implement "home" or "storage cache" for depositing. 

Nice To Have List:
1. Enable printing of relevant information about tile/square by mouse click.
2. Somehow fix PyGame now allowing text to be printed on screen (!?)
