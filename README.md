AntHill.

Ants exhibit complex behaviour, including constructing some of nature's finest palaces, without any direct oversight, direction or individual intelligence. They achieve all of this through hive behaviour controlled by only a few signals. This project aims to replicate this behaviour for a hive of ant-like entities.
